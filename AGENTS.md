# pi-acp (ACP adapter for pi-coding-agent)

This repository implements an **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** adapter for **pi** (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) without modifying pi.

- ACP side: **JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio** using `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript)
- Pi side: spawn `pi --mode rpc` and communicate via **newline-delimited JSON** over stdio

## Architecture (MVP)

### 1 ACP session ↔ 1 pi subprocess

Pi RPC mode is effectively single-session, so the adapter maps:

- `session/new` → spawn a dedicated `pi --mode rpc` process
- `session/prompt` → send `{type:"prompt"}` to that process and stream events back as `session/update`
- `session/cancel` → send `{type:"abort"}`

### ACP server wiring (modeled after opencode)

Use `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`:

- `ndJsonStream(input, output)` to speak ACP over stdio
- `new AgentSideConnection((conn) => new PiAcpAgent(conn, config), stream)`

## Implementation constraints / decisions

- ACP client-side **filesystem** delegation is implemented (see "Client filesystem delegation" below). ACP **terminal** delegation is still not implemented; pi executes locally.
- Ignore `mcpServers` for MVP (accept in params, store in session state).
- Stream all pi assistant output as ACP `agent_message_chunk` initially.
- Tool events: map pi tool execution events to ACP `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` (as text content).

## Client filesystem delegation

When the ACP client advertises `fs.readTextFile` / `fs.writeTextFile`, file access is
routed through the client so the editor owns agent edits (they land in its buffers as
reviewable, undoable changes) and reads observe unsaved work.

Pi performs its own file I/O inside its subprocess, so the adapter cannot intercept it
from the outside. Instead:

- `src/pi-ext/acp-client-fs.ts` is a **pi extension** loaded into the subprocess with
  `pi --extension`. It re-registers pi's own `read`/`write`/`edit` tool definitions
  (`createReadToolDefinition` and friends) with custom `operations`, so schemas, result
  shapes, diffs and renderers stay identical to the built-ins and only the I/O is redirected.
- `src/acp/fs-bridge.ts` runs a local socket server in the adapter. The extension calls it;
  it forwards to the ACP client and falls back to disk if the client refuses or errors.
- `src/acp/client-fs.ts` is the adapter-side wrapper used for pre-edit diff snapshots.

Set `PI_ACP_DISABLE_CLIENT_FS=1` to force the legacy disk-only behavior.

Both halves must stay tolerant of failure: any client error falls back to local disk so the
adapter still works with clients that advertise the capability but reject specific paths.

## Dev workflow (to be filled once scaffold exists)

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run in dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Smoke test (stdio): `npm run smoke`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Test: `npm run test`

## Manual testing notes

Once the adapter runs, it should behave like an ACP agent on stdio.

Quick sanity test (example):

```bashN
# Send initialize request via stdin (exact fields depend on ACP SDK version)
# echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":1}}' | node dist/index.js
```

For real validation, test with an ACP client (e.g. Zed external agent).

## Coding guidelines

- Keep ACP protocol handling in `src/acp/*`.
- Keep pi RPC subprocess logic in `src/pi-rpc/*`.
- Prefer small translation functions (pi event → ACP session/update) with unit tests.
- Be strict about streaming and process cleanup (handle exit, drain stdout/stderr, timeouts).
- Avoid producing unnecessary comments! Use comments sparingly to explain non-obvious decisions, not to narrate code.
- Avoid using `any` in TypeScript; prefer explicit types and interfaces. Only use `any` when absolutely necessary (e.g. for untyped external data).

## Validation

- After making code edits, run formatting before finishing the task. Use `npm run format` when it is safe to format the whole worktree; otherwise use the narrowest safe formatter command for the files you touched.
- If formatting is skipped or fails, say so explicitly in the final response.

## Source control

- **DO NOT** commit unless explicitly asked!

## Client information

- Current ACP client is Zed
